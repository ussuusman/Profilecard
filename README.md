# Profilecard

## Overview

This project is a simple and elegant **Profile Card** built using HTML and CSS. The card is designed to showcase a user's basic information, such as their name, profile picture, profession, and social media links, in a visually appealing format.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The card layout adapts to different screen sizes for better usability on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Profile Image:** Displays a circular profile picture at the top of the card.
- **User Information:** Includes the user's name, profession, and a short bio or description.
- **Social Media Links:** Provides clickable icons or links to the user's social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub).
- **Custom Styling:** Uses CSS for custom fonts, colors, shadows, and hover effects to enhance the visual appeal.

## How It Works

- The structure of the card is created using semantic HTML elements such as `<div>`, `<img>`, `<h3>`, and `<p>`.
- CSS is used to style the card, including layout, spacing, colors, and responsive behavior.
- Social media icons can be added using icon libraries (like Font Awesome) or SVG images.
